# Pandas-Project
# My First Pandas Data Cleaning Project.

Hey there! Welcome to my first data cleaning project using Python's pandas library. I am still learning the ropes, but I am excited to share my progress.

## What's This Project About?
This was my hands-on practice session to clean a dataset. I took a raw, messy CSV file and worked through the pandas basics to make it tidy and analysis-ready!

## What's in Here?
*   `pompin pandas.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook where I did all my work. You can see my code, my mistakes, and my thought process!
*   `[my_analysis_data].csv`: The final cleaned dataset that I exported.
*   `[Customer Call List].csv`:The original raw data I started with.

## What I Practiced (My Learning Goals!)
*   Loading data into a pandas DataFrame.
*   Exploring the data with `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.
*   Handling missing values (I tried out `.dropna()` and `.fillna()`!).
*   Fixing data types (converting strings to numbers and dates).
*   Removing duplicates and renaming columns for clarity.
*   Finally, exporting my clean data to a new CSV file!

## How to Run This
1.  **Download the files** above.
2.  **Open the notebook** in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3.  **Run the cells** to see the process step-by-step!

## Note from Me
I'm brand new to data analysis using pandas, so this project is all about learning and growth. I am eager to keep improving and tackling more complex problems! If you have any feedback or tips, I'd love to hear them.

*   I am getting more comfortable with Python every day.

Thanks for stopping by.
